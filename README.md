**Objective**:

The objective of a to-do list in Python is to create a simple, interactive tool for managing and organizing tasks. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and track their progress effectively.



**Key Activities**:

1.Add Task: Adds a task to the to-do list.

2.View Tasks: Displays the tasks and their completion status.

3.Complete Task: Marks a task as completed.

4.Delete Task: Deletes a task from the to-do list.



**TECHNOLOGIES USED**:

A Python-based to-do list can be built using the following technologies:

1. **Tkinter**: For creating a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can add, remove, and view tasks.

2. **SQLite**: A lightweight database to store tasks persistently.

3. **Flask** (optional): For building a web-based to-do list where users can interact via a browser.

4. **JSON**: To store tasks locally in a file-based format if not using a database.
